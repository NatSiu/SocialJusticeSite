Projecr 3 - Social Justic Website

by Nathan Siu

# project overview
There are many causes in the world that need support. A lot of these cause might not affect us directly in the present, but will likely affect us in the long run. Choosing a cause that I am passionate about, I chose to focus on Climate Change.

Climate Change is an issue that has been going on for centuries. Each year, the issue seems to get worse and worse and becomes more and more exacerbated by human activities.

# technical overview
The contents of the page like text and images is layed out using HTML in order to get the general placement of where each element will be. Using CSS, styling is applied to each element like font color, background color, positioning, etc.
